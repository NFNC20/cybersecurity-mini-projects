# Project 01 – Password Security Basics

## Goal
Understand basic principles of password security and common weaknesses.

## Background
Passwords are still one of the most common authentication methods. Weak or reused passwords are a major security risk.

## Approach
- Compare weak and strong password characteristics
- Analyze why password length matters
- Understand common attack methods (e.g. brute force) on a conceptual level

## Key Learnings
- Short passwords are highly vulnerable
- Length is often more important than complexity
- Reusing passwords increases overall risk
